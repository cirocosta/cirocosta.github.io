        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
          Hi!
          I'm <a href="https://github.com/cirocosta">cirocosta</a> on Github, <a href="https://twitter.com.br/cirowrc">cirowrc</a> on Twitter and <a href="https://google.com/+CiroSCosta">ciroscosta</a> on Google+. You can get in touch with me on these places :). If only interested on what i'm doing, go check my public activity on GitHub. I'm there everyday :P
        </p>

        <p>I'm currently 20, studying Actuarial Science at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP) - which is a course that i felt in love regarding it's specificities and how it relates to both economics, mathematics and computation (in Brazil there's a VERY little number of startups doing something interesting using actuarial science ... i really hope to do something with the knowledge i'm obtaining from this area that is so small here in Brazil. If you want to discuss something relating to this - actually, regarding anything :P - get in touch!).</p>

        <p>
          Also, i just started giving talks recently (and loving it! <strong>sharing knowledge is awesome</strong>). Some of them can be found on <a href="https://cirocosta.github.io/talks">cirocosta/talks</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests and what i've done so far</h2>

        <p>
          I'm someone who jumped from one technology to another some various times, although not having so much time in programming. As i'm now trying to focus, currently my interests are:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <details open>
                <summary>Web Technology</summary>
                <p>Maybe as most of those who started programming for the web in the last 2 years, i started with jQuery, studying it intensively till the point of deciding to do everything with pure JS and learn from its source code a bunch of tricks that it does. Thanks to OSS i was able to fulfill my curiosity and learn a lot. Although not currently using jQuery, what i want to state here is that i'm currently trying to learn from other people's code. There are some very smart programmers out there open sourcing what they are doing and this is like free class from the top minds on their fields.</p>

                <p>I'm currently <strong>enjoying so much <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">ReactJS</a></strong> and also contributing to it. There are so many clever tricks in its source code and how its architecture was planned that i just felt in love with the project. I'm very interested in FRP (functional reactive programming) and can't wait to learn more, as well as pure functional programming, which brings some crazy awesome concepts.</p>

                <p>Talking about work, some friends and i founded a Startup for 8 months (time to invalidate the idea by really touching the market - although now, after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hard-Thing-About-Things/dp/0062273205">The Hard Thing About the Hard Things</a> i regret i hadn't insisted more ...) with some friends (and learning so damn much - lots of SQL and database syncing problems - which is a great problem to dig into, it is not easy but very interesting -, native Android and communication with web services, front end, using python not only for sci, but for web ...), then, after that experience, got in touch with NodeJS and joined <a href="http://www.apontador.com.br/">Apontador</a>, the lead local search website in Brazil, which was an <strong>amazing</strong> opportunity. There i used to help improving the internal framework, as well as its documentation and also creating some front end products. Coding for REAL production was a great experience!</p>

                <summary>Hardware</summary>
                <p>I'm currently involved with building an Automatic Pipetting Bot for a <a href="http://cienciasusp.com/openpipettingbot">project</a> at the <a href="http://www5.usp.br/en/">University</a>. It's been <strong>really</strong> fun and benefic: I'm learning a bunch about Arduino & electronics in general as well as numerical control.</p>

                <p>This is very interesting as i was never very good at electronics, and this experience has been teaching me a lot. Learn by making is awesome. Currently my task is to build the algorithm for creating the optimal GCODE for the optimal path that we'll use in the firmware flashed to the Arduino to control our motors, which are disposed in a very cleaver way to reduce weight although keeping the precision (see <a href="http://corexy.com/theory.html">corexy</a>).</p>

                <p>For a presentation a friend of mine (<a href="https://github.com/MateusZitelli">Mateus Zitelli</a>) and i developped a Led matrix, which is a hardware representation (100 physical LEDS connected using Multiplexing strategy) of a state of matrix (from a desktop application using node-webkit). The project is currently on Github (<a href="https://github.com/cirocosta/ledmatrix">cirocosta/ledmatrix</a>) with references to some of other repositories that we developed during that little journey.</p>

                <summary>Native Code</summary>
                <p>My first language wasn't JS or Python. I started coding in C at the university at the Institute of Physics, where i got really excited about programming. Nowadays i continue interested on this C/C++ code, although this is not something i take much seriously. The last project i was involved with pure C was a <a href="https://github.com/cirocosta/cube-raid">project using OpenGL</a> to create the basics of a 3D-Game. As we were not allowed to use external libs, autobuild tools and any help, the code ended kinda messy but i'm a little proud of it. Learned some great concepts developing a game from the scratch :). My next project (which i just started doing some research) is very native-code dependent, then i'll take a deep study on this topic. Not much more to say about this yet :)</p>

        </p>

        <p>I also have some sort of experience with Android (~8,9 months developing intensily + a talk gave at GDG-SP: <a href="https://cirocosta.github.io/talks/gcm">talk</a>). For sometime studied about Machine Learning related topics (completed 50% of Stanfords's ML Course on Coursera 75% of Introduction to Data Science - sadly was with no time to complete them).</p>

        <p>Last but not least: <strong>I'm passionate about OSS.</strong></p>
