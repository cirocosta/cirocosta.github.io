            <summary>Better Apps with GCM - <time datetime="2013-11-5">5 November, 2013</time> # GDG-SP</summary>
            <p>There's a big difference between apps that are trully responsive and operates almost in real time from those who are clearly static or updates come in a way that is not recent. In approximately 40 min i try to make it clear what are the pros and cons of using GCM to make your app more delightful with almost real-time updates using Google Cloud Messaging (through HTTP and XMPP).</p>

            <summary>Testing with NodeJS - <time datetime="2014-08-30">30 August, 2014</time> # Node-BR</summary>
            <p>Javascript is an amazing language. Almost everybody who is into frontend development loves it specially regarding its expressiveness. But, there's a problem with that: we are allowed to do a lot of things that fail without knowing. In this talk i try to show how to test Javascript code focusing on both NodeJS and the browser, finishing with an end-to-end testing solution for code that must be isomorphic.</p>

            <summary>Breaking Barriers with Web Development - <time datetime="2014-09-27">27 September, 2014</time> # Node-BR</summary>
            <p>We, front end delevopers, are always accostumed with the web and have already gained so much experience from this. We have the advantage of taking care of UIs and creating beautiful products. But, there's a trend going on: IOT. In this presentation i talk about how, with web tools, we are able, nowadays, to develop for hardware and also desktop with the technologies we are already familiar. In the end, a demo showing a 10x10 led matrix controled by a node-webkit app with ReactJS + Flux as frontend architecture.</p>
